## Hello, I'm Beg√ºm üëã 

I'm a graduate student at UChicago's [Computational Analysis and Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) program. I'm passionate about leveraging data science for social improvement projects. My particular focus is on how data visualization impacts decision making.  
  
üí¨ Ask me about: my private repositories! Due to intellectual property reasons I cannot make them public but can provide upon request.   
üßë‚Äçüíª Currently working on: assisting a project at UChicago's Data Cognition Lab that explores geospatial uncertainty in data visualizations. 

## Projects

üå≤ [Green Space Accessibility for Affordable Housing in Chicago](https://github.com/begumakkas/Green-Space-Access.git) (February 2025): Developed an Accessibility Index combining park ratings, size, and walkable proximity to quantify the quality of public green space access for residents in affordable housing communities. Built a dashboard to visualize and interact with the Accessibility Index.

üó∫Ô∏è Meta Data Analysis of Fraym's Product (Summer 2025): Built a dashboard using Python and Streamlit that samples and analyzes Fraym's ML ensemble model. Users are able to identify areas of inefficiency and improvement in the ensemble by using the dashboard. This is a private repository, but a demo video can be provided upon request. 

Private repositories include but are not limited to:  
- Simulating Voter Behavior at the Precinct Level
- Analyzing Political Tweets Using NLP Techniques
- Custom Hash Table Built in Python
- Text Authorship Inference Using Markov Chains
- Web Crawling and Data Extraction Using lxml
- Entity Matching with Record Linkage Methods
- Supervised Classification with Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors
