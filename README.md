## Hello, I'm Beg√ºm üëã 

I'm a graduate student at UChicago's [Computational Analysis and Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) program. I'm passionate about leveraging data science for social improvement projects. My particular focus is on geospatial analysis and data visualization.  

üå± Currently learning: advanced geospatial techniques and its applications to machine learning models.  
üí¨ Ask me about: my private repositories! Due to intellectual property reasons I cannot make them public but can provide upon request. 

## Projects

üå≤ [Green Space Accessibility for Affordable Housing in Chicago](https://github.com/begumakkas/Green-Space-Access.git) (February 2025): Developed an Accessibility Index combining park ratings, size, and walkable proximity to quantify the quality of public green space access for residents in affordable housing communities. Built a dashboard to visualize and interact with the Accessibility Index.

Private repositories include but are not limited to:  
- Simulating Voter Behavior at the Precinct Level
- Analyzing Political Tweets Using NLP Techniques
- Custom Hash Table Built in Python
- Text Authorship Inference Using Markov Chains
- Web Crawling and Data Extraction Using lxml
- Search Interface and Backend Built with SQLite
- Entity Matching with Record Linkage Methods
- Supervised Classification with Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors
